Respond with a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "activities": [
    {
      "id": "act_1",
      "name": "Activity Name",
      "category": "one of: Academics | Sports | Arts & Music | Volunteering | Clubs | Work & Leadership | Certifications",
      "description": "A 1-2 sentence summary of the activity. Do NOT include hours, duration, or achievements here.",
      "details": ["Specific facts not in the description — responsibilities, projects, events"],
      "yearsActive": "e.g. Grade 9-11 or 2 years (if mentioned)",
      "role": "their role if mentioned",
      "achievements": ["Only standout accomplishments: awards, certifications, competitions, leadership titles"],
      "hoursPerWeek": null,
      "isDetailedEnough": false
    }
  ],
  "followUpQuestions": [
    {
      "id": "q_1",
      "activityId": "act_1",
      "activityName": "Activity Name",
      "question": "A casual, specific follow-up question"
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Generate a unique id for each activity (act_1, act_2, etc.) and question (q_1, q_2, etc.)
- CRITICAL: Do not duplicate information across fields. Each fact goes in exactly ONE place:
  - "description": 1-2 sentence summary only
  - "details": specific facts NOT already in the description
  - "yearsActive": duration ONLY goes here
  - "hoursPerWeek": time commitment ONLY goes here (as a number)
  - "role": position/title ONLY goes here
  - "achievements": ONLY impressive accomplishments (awards, certs, competitions, ranks)
- Set isDetailedEnough to true if the student gave enough info (role, duration, specifics)
- Only generate follow-up questions for activities where isDetailedEnough is false
- 2 questions max per activity
- Questions should be casual and specific
- If an activity is very detailed already, don't ask about it
- Categorize each activity into the best-fit category`;
