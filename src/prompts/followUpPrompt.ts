  return `A student answered follow-up questions about their activities. Update their activity profiles with the new info. Do NOT generate any follow-up questions — this is the final round.

Current activities:
${activitiesJson}

Their answers:
${answersJson}

Respond with a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "updatedActivities": [
    {
      "id": "act_1",
      "name": "Activity Name",
      "category": "Category",
      "description": "A 1-2 sentence summary of what this activity is and the student's involvement. Do NOT include hours, duration, or achievements here.",
      "details": ["Specific facts NOT already in the description — e.g. specific responsibilities, projects, events. Do NOT repeat hours, duration, or role here."],
      "yearsActive": "updated if answered",
      "role": "updated if answered",
      "achievements": ["Only standout accomplishments: awards, certifications, competitions, leadership titles. NOT hours or duration."],
      "hoursPerWeek": 5,
      "isDetailedEnough": true
    }
  ],
  "followUpQuestions": []
}

Rules:
- Merge the answers into the existing activity data
- CRITICAL: Do not duplicate information across fields. Each fact should appear in exactly ONE place:
  - "description": 1-2 sentence summary of the activity
  - "details": specific facts, responsibilities, projects — things not in the description
  - "yearsActive": duration info ONLY goes here
  - "hoursPerWeek": time commitment ONLY goes here (as a number)
  - "role": position/title ONLY goes here
  - "achievements": ONLY impressive accomplishments (awards, certs, competitions, ranks)
- Set followUpQuestions to an empty array — no more questions
- Return ALL activities (even ones that weren't asked about), not just updated ones`;
}
